                Osiris, the god of the afterlife, resurrection, and fertility, was a central
                figure in Egyptian mythology. Betrayed and killed by his brother Seth, he was
                resurrected by Isis and became ruler of the underworld. He judged souls in the Hall
                of Maâ€™at, ensuring justice. Worshipped as a symbol of rebirth, his legacy shaped Egyptian
                beliefs about life after death.
