                Thoth, god of wisdom and writing, was Egypt’s divine scribe. With an ibis head,
                he recorded events and upheld Ma’at. He invented writing, math, and sciences,
                guiding gods and humans. Thoth judged souls, helped resurrect Osiris, and shaped
                Egyptian knowledge. As the patron of scribes, his influence lasted for centuries.
