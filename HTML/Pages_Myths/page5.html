                Seth, god of chaos and war, was feared for his strength and unpredictability.
                He killed Osiris for the throne but was later defeated by Horus. Despite his
                dark side, he protected Ra by battling Apophis. Symbolizing destruction and
                change, he was both feared and respected, especially by warriors and rulers
