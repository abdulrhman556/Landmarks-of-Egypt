                Hathor, goddess of love, beauty, and motherhood, was a beloved deity in Egypt.
                Depicted with cow horns, she symbolized nurturing and joy. She welcomed souls
                into the afterlife and ruled over music and dance. As Horus’s wife, she protected
                pharaohs. Her temple at Dendera remains one of Egypt’s most stunning sacred sites.
