                Sekhmet, the lion-headed goddess, was a fierce warrior and healer in Egyptian mythology.
                Created by Ra to punish humanity, she became uncontrollable. To stop her, Ra tricked her
                into drinking red-dyed beer. Calming down, she transformed into a protector. Sekhmet embodied
                both destruction and healing,
                with temples built in her honor and priests seeking her blessings.
